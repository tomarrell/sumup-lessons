# Last week...

Last week (2 weeks ago) we covered the basics of Git.

We also had a look at the role of GitHub and its relation to Git.

# Switch Statements

A switch statement is a short way to write a series of if statements. It will
execute the a single branch â€“ the first statement in the list which is equal to
the "condition."

---

# Switch Example

```go
...

func main() {
  color := "blue"

  switch color {
  case "blue":
    fmt.Println("The color of my car")
  case "red":
    fmt.Println("The color of my hat")
  case "green":
    fmt.Println("The color of my grass")
  default:
    fmt.Println("I have nothing of this color")
  }
}
```

---

# Switch Condition

If you omit the condition in the switch statement, the first branch that matches
with `true` will be selected.

---

# Switch Truthy Example

```go
...

func main() {
  color := "blue"

  switch {
  case true: // Will always print here
    fmt.Println("The color of my car")
  case false:
    fmt.Println("The color of my hat")
  case color == "blue":
    fmt.Println("The color of my grass")
  default:
    fmt.Println("I have nothing of this color")
  }
}
```

---

# Switch Break

If you want to break early from a switch statement, you can use the `break`
statement.

```go
...

func main() {
  color := "blue"

  switch {
  case true: // Will always print here
    fmt.Println("The color of my car")
    if color == "blue"
      break;
    }
    fmt.Println("The color is not blue")
  default:
    fmt.Println("I have nothing of this color")
  }
}
```

---

# Switch Fallthrough

```go
v := 42
switch v {
case 100:
	fmt.Println(100)
	fallthrough
case 42:
	fmt.Println(42)
	fallthrough
case 1:
	fmt.Println(1)
	fallthrough
default:
	fmt.Println("default")
}
// Output:
// 42
// 1
// default
```

---

# Switch Fallthrough

A fallthrough statement must be the last thing in the case.

The following will not work.

```go
switch {
case f():
	if g() {
		fallthrough // Does not work!
	}
	h()
default:
	error()
}
```

Fallthrough also does not work in a type switch.

---

# Multiple Cases

You can trigger the same case with multiple values by using a comma separated
list.

```go
func colors(color string) bool {
	switch color {
	case "blue", "red", "green":
		return true
	}
	return false
}
```

---

# Noop Case

Sometimes you want certain cases to do nothing.

```go
func pluralEnding(n int) string {
	ending := ""

	switch n {
	case 1:
	default:
		ending = "s"
	}

	return ending
}

fmt.Sprintf("foo%s\n", pluralEnding(1))  == "foo"
fmt.Sprintf("bar%s\n", pluralEnding(2))  == "bars"
```
